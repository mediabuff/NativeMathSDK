# NativeMathSDK
This is an attempt to follow MS's [Walkthrough: Creating an SDK using C++](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibility/walkthrough-creating-an-sdk-using-cpp)

As per step 11 the `lib`, `DLL`s, `pri` and `winmd` files built from the `NativeMath` and `NativeMathWRT` projects have been copied and comitted in the `NativeMathVSIX` directory structure where appropriate.
